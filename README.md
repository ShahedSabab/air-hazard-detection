# Air Hazard Detection

This project utilizes a ML algorithms to detect air quality conditions in parts of the United Stated based on satellite data. A Tableau dashboard is included to visualize the predicted Air Quality Index (AQI) in different regions. The visualization tool also includes ancillary data to access the impact of the detection.
