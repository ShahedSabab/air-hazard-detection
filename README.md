# Air Hazard Detection

This project utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to detect air quality conditions in parts of the United Stated based on satellite data. A Tableau dashboard is included to visualize the maximum detection from the machine learning algorithm. The visualization tool also includes ancillary data to access the impact of the detection.
